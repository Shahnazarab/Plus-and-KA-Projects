Who are we? âž•
Plus Support (Team) creates the best-in-class service experience for our Plus Merchants. We are committed to consistently challenging assumptions and pushing the boundaries of Shopify (and industry) standards of enterprise support, and are striving to be the industry example of exceptional high touch, high care experiences.

In May 2023 Plus Support joined forces with Key Account Support in a new formation, bringing both teams back together to support Merchants on the Plus Platform.

The Team spans across 4 regions; EMEA, Canada East, Canada West and APAC, working 24/7 to Support our largest GMV Merchants for Plus & Enterprise.

Our Purpose ðŸŽ¯
We help Plus merchants make more money by advocating for their business needs and delivering a tailored and holistic service experience with Shopify.
